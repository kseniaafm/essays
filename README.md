###How nuclear energy is generated

The first law of thermodynamics asserts that heat is energy, which is the ultimate goal of nuclear energy. This heat is generated in the process of nuclear fission. In case of nuclear reactors they simply house the process of nuclear fission, which is the process of splitting atoms into smaller atoms which then generate heat and radiation. It occurs when a nuetron hits a larger atom which is then split into two smaller atoms and some neutrons. The neutrons created from the split can then generate a chain reaction by hitting other large atoms and so on. In the case of most common nuclear reactos, the fuel of choice is uranium, this acts as the large atom in nuclear fission. Uranium is the fuel of choice because it is because its atoms easily split apart, and its easy to initiate and control and its abundant on Earth. 




###The process of nuclear energy production


Firstly, uranium is processed in order to increase the concentration of uranium atoms. Then it is pressed into little uranium pellets which are then packed into long metal rods called fuel rods. [^1] The fuel rods are grouped together to make a fuel assembly. The process of nuclear fission starts generating heat in the fuel assembly. The heat generated boils water which is located either in the same compartment or in a separate location. The location of the water is the determined by the kind of the reactor at use. The boiling water turns to steam which spins an electricity generating turbine. The steam is then condensed and the water gets recycled once more. The process is controlled by control rods which absorb extra neutrons in order to slow down or stop the reaction. Control rods are made from neutron absorbing materials such as boron and silver, which aid in the hindering of neutrons which continue the nuclear fission chain reaction. One can moderate the speed and ability of generating energy by inserting the control rods for a certain length or removing them entirely. 

###Types of reactors {.cards}

There are 2 kinds of nuclear reactor designs currently used in the United States and their main difference is the way they generate steam. One of them is the pressurized water reactors, which are more common. This kind of reactor uses the water as a medium for heat transfer, in which the hot water kept under pressure and then used for the generation of steam, which is then used in the turbine for electricity generator. The other reactor is the boiling water reactor and it is less common. This reactor uses the heat that are coming off the fuel rods in order to heat the water directly. 




#### Pressurized Water Reactor

Water is heated by the nuclear reactor and kept under high pressures, afterwards it is transformed into steam by a steam generator which is used in the electric turbine[^2]

#### Boiling Water Reactor

Water is heated by the nuclear reactor, the boiling temperatures produce steam which would then be used for electricity generation [^2]

###The Choronobyl reactor

The previous 2 reactors were moderated and cooled by water, which means that they slow down the neutrons used in nuclear fission. The type of reactor that was used in Choronobyl is a RBMK, high-power channel reactor. This kind of reactor is cooled by water but moderated by graphite control rods. This means that a core of solid graphite is used for slowing down neutrons in the reactor core. This reactor was created with several factors taken into account, mostly to save on costs. The first factor was that the fabrication of RBMK parts can be done at existing manufacturing plants, which would save money by not having to build new factories for parts. The energy output was also very important since most of the Soviet Union relied on nuclear energy for cheaper electricty, so the RBMK reactor had no upper power limits. The RBMK was considered to have a state of the art safety protocol, with more than 1000 primary circuits which would increase the safety of the reactor system. Lastly, the fuel itself was highly efficient as it was able to use slightly less enriched uranium than in other common reactos which saved money. 


###The reactor explosion

The explosion started when the reactor came in contact with normal water without the protection of the control rods, which elementally separated the water which blew the lid off the reactor. This hot steam explosion set off a chain of events which led to the graphite of the control rods to melt. The melted graphite when mixed with other elements such as nuclear fuel and fission products, created corium which then turned to the now called “elephant foot”. 

Some say that the Choronobyl reactor was doomed to fail. That is due to the numerous design flaws in its creation. The first issue was that the reactor had a positive void coefficient. This means that when there is an increase of steam in the core or  a "void" of neutron-absorbing water, the reactivity of the reactor will increase. Compared to the  boiling water or pressurized water style reactors, they would have a negative void coefficient which will decrease in reactivity with an increase of steam in the core. This provides an extra level of safety and support for the security of the reactor. The second issue is that there was a way for the operators to manually override the emergency protocol. This creates an issue of human error, whereas if there was no way to override it and the safety protocol was in place it would be more safe without human interference. Lastly, the control rods took a long time to come into position, 18 seconds. While 18 seconds does not seem like much, this timing has now been changed to 12 seconds, and the extra 6 seconds could make a difference between life and death.
