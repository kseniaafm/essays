###How nuclear energy is generated

The first law of thermodynamics asserts that heat is energy, which is the ultimate goal of nuclear energy. This heat is generated in the process of nuclear fission. In case of nuclear reactors they simply house the process of nuclear fission, which is the process of splitting atoms into smaller atoms which then generate heat and radiation. It occurs when a nuetron hits a larger atom which is then split into two smaller atoms and some neutrons. The neutrons created from the split can then generate a chain reaction by hitting other large atoms and so on. In the case of most common nuclear reactos, the fuel of choice is uranium, this acts as the large atom in nuclear fission. Uranium is the fuel of choice because it is because its atoms easily split apart, and its easy to initiate and control and its abundant on Earth. 




###The process of nuclear energy production


Firstly, uranium is processed in order to increase the concentration of uranium atoms. Then it is pressed into little uranium pellets which are then packed into long metal rods called fuel rods. [^1] The fuel rods are grouped together to make a fuel assembly. The process of nuclear fission starts generating heat in the fuel assembly. The heat generated boils water which is located either in the same compartment or in a separate location. The location of the water is the determined by the kind of the reactor at use. The boiling water turns to steam which spins an electricity generating turbine. The steam is then condensed and the water gets recycled once more. The process is controlled by control rods which absorb extra neutrons in order to slow down or stop the reaction. Control rods are made from neutron absorbing materials such as boron and silver, which aid in the hindering of neutrons which continue the nuclear fission chain reaction. One can moderate the speed and ability of generating energy by inserting the control rods for a certain length or removing them entirely.
